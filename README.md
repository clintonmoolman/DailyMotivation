In this project I have created a local server running on port:3000 using Express with Node.js.

The aim of the project is to give users a motivational messages depending on the current day of the week,
which must first be obtained by using the getDay() method, and using EJS tags to render data as HTML.

The project was created using Embedded JavaScript,JavaScript, Node.js and Express.js.

To start the program:
* open the terminal in your editor
* cd to the folder where you have saved the project on your PC
* initialise NPM
* install express and ejs packages (npm init express ejs)
* Start the server (node index.js)

 In your browser go to localhost:3000
